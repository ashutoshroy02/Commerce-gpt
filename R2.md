📚 Commerce-GPT: An AI-Driven Knowledge System for Commerce Education

🔬 Abstract

Commerce-GPT is an advanced Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned for commerce education, leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and vector database architectures. The system is designed to provide high-fidelity, chapter-specific responses to students of NIOS, CBSE, and other academic curricula. By integrating knowledge graph mapping, contextual embeddings, and multimodal retrieval mechanisms, Commerce-GPT ensures pedagogically optimized outputs.
